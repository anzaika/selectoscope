## State of the project

### 1.0.0

We're [currently working on 1.0.0](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues?milestone=18),
which as far as dependencies, moves us from meta_search to Ransack and adds Rails 4 & 5 support.

You can get it by tracking master:
```ruby
gem 'activeadmin', github: 'activeadmin'
```

Or you can using rubygems:
```ruby
gem 'activeadmin', '~> 1.0.0.pre4'
```

*Keep in mind that during the time where we use `pre`-release label, things can break in each release!*

### Rails 5

Active Admin master has preliminary support for Rails 5. To give it a try, these Gemfile changes may be needed:

```ruby
gem 'inherited_resources', github: 'activeadmin/inherited_resources'
gem 'ransack',             github: 'activerecord-hackery/ransack'
gem 'draper',              '> 3.x'
gem 'sass-rails',          github: 'rails/sass-rails' # For Sprockets 4
```

If something isn't working for you please report it on [#4177](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/4177).

### 0.6.x

The plan is to follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) as of 1.0.0. The 0.6.x line will
still be maintained, and we will backport bug fixes into future 0.6.x releases. If you don't want
to have to wait for a release, you can track the branch instead:

```ruby
gem 'activeadmin', github: 'activeadmin', branch: '0-6-stable'
```
